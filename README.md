# Dave's Donuts

Daily Happiness is a mock landing page for an imaginary donut site. This was the first real solo project I did, so it's rather special to me.

## Usage

This was mostly me just practicing relevant CSS styling and animations. Have fun clicking around and looking at what I was able to do.
